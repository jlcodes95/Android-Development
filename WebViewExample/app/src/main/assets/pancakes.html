    <h1> 5 most common mistakes that are ruining your pancakes</h1>
    <h3> By: Susan Holtham </h3>
    <p>
        Pancake Day, oh Pancake Day. No Shrove Tuesday would be worth its weight in eggs, milk and flour without stacks of steaming pancakes scattered around the kitchen. Originally a pagan holiday, round, hot pancakes were made on Shrove Tuesday to represent the sun and the reemergence of light and heat after winter. Now a Christian celebration of the last day before the fasting of Lent begins, the word ‘shrove’ comes from ‘shrive’, meaning to free yourself from sin. Historically and today, families would feast on foods in the house that wouldn’t last over Lent and pancakes were an easy way to use up milk, eggs and fats — giving rise to the French name Mardi Gras aka ‘fat Tuesday’. Whether you like to pile ’em high with berries and syrup or fold them swimming in lashings of lemon and sugar, here are our fail-safe tips for avoiding common mistakes that’ll leave you with (pan)cake on your face (or in bits, on the floor).
    </p>
    <h2> 1. Don’t scrimp on ingredients </h2>
    <p>
    With so few ingredients in them in the first place, don’t be tempted to reach for years-old flour or raising agents. You’ll only enter into a doomed battle against sad saggy pancakes where the goal of light, fluffy discs will remain a Pinterest dream. Use the freshest eggs too because: a) this will really help any rise that’s dependent on separated, whisked egg whites and b) you owe it to your belly and your pancakes to use the freshest, higher welfare eggs you can get.
    </p>
    <h2> 2. Leave the batter to rest </h2>
    <p>
    After whisking your wet and dry ingredients together until just combined, even if there’s a little lump or two in there, (beating with a heavy hand overworks the gluten, leading to a tough and chewy pancake and waving goodbye to lightness and fluff) leave that bowl of batter to rest. It might be the complete opposite of the thing you want to do — i.e. pour all of it into the pan at once to make mega pancake to eat straight away and dip in a bowl of your favourite nut butter like you would a carrot in hummus — but you have to be cruel to yourself to be kind to the pancake. Leave your batter to rest for 5 to 30 minutes. Use the chance to do a little clearing up or start on that melted chocolate topping. This allows time for the gluten to relax (how many times gluten, just calm it down) and will help give you soft, tender pancakes. This tip works a treat if you’re after a show-stopping high rise on Yorkshire puddings too.
